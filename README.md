Delphi header translation for Point Grey FlyCapture

This isn't a complete header translation, I only did the parts I needed to get things up and running. It should be a good starting point for most projects though.

Special thanks to Moment Research Corporation where I worked while writing this code. They have generously allowed it into the public domain.
